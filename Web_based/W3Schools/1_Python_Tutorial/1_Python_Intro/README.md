### Why Python?
* Works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
* __Has a simple syntax similar to English language.__
* __Has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewere lines than some other programming languages.__
* __Runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written__. This mean that __prototyping can be very quick__.
* __Can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way__.

### Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
* __Readability:__ Designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influnce from mathematics.
* __New Lines:__ Uses new lines to complete a command, as __opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses__.
* __Indentation:__ 
  * Python relies on __indentation, using whitespace__, to define scope: such as the __scope of loops, functions and classes__.
