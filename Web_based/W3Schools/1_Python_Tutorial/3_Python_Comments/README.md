### Python Comments
* Comments can be used to explain Python code.
* Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
* Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

### Creating a Comment
* Comments starts with a `#`, and Python will ignore them.
* Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line.
* Please see the illustration: [Comments](Comments.py)
* A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code.
