### Python Indentation:
* Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
* Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
* Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
* Python will give us error if we skip the indentation.
* The number of spaces is upto us as a programmers, but it has to be at least one.
* We have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give us an error:
> `if 5 > 2:`
> &nbsp;&nbsp;`print("Five is greater than two!")`
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print("Five is greater than two!")`
* Please see the illustration: [Indentation](Indentation.py) 

### Python Variables
* In Python, variables are created when we assign a value to it.
* Python has no command for declaring a variable.
* Please see the illustration:
[Variables](Varibales.py) 

### Python Comments
* Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
* Commnets start with a `#`, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment.
* Please see the illustration: [Comments](Comments.py)
